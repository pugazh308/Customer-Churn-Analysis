📊 Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecom Industry

📌 Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn rates, understand customer behavior, and help businesses improve retention strategies. The analysis includes handling missing values, filtering inactive users, statistical summarization, categorical analysis, and data visualization.

Abstract:

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, affecting revenue and customer retention strategies. This project analyzes key factors contributing to churn, such as customer tenure, recharge history, and contract type. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and filtering out inactive users to ensure accurate insights.

Through statistical summarization, we examine churn rates across different plans, and categorical analysis helps understand churn behavior based on contract types. Data visualizations further highlight customer retention trends, providing telecom companies with actionable insights to improve service quality, refine pricing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.

🚀 Features:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Handling missing values  
- Filtering inactive users  
- Statistical summarization (churn rate per plan)  
- Categorical analysis (churn by contract type)  
- Data visualization (customer retention trends)
